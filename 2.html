<h2>CSS</h2>
<p style = "margin - top : 10px">
  <br>Stands for "Cascading Style Sheet."
  <br>Cascading style sheets are used to format the layout of Web pages.
  <br>They can be used to define text styles, table sizes, and other aspects of Web pages that previously could only be defined in a page's HTML.

<p style = "margin - top : 5px">
  <br>CSS helps Web developers create a uniform look across several pages of a Web site.
  <br>Instead of defining the style of each table and each block of text within a page's HTML,
  <br>commonly used styles need to be defined only once in a CSS document.
  <br>Once the style is defined in cascading style sheet, it can be used by any page that references the CSS file. Plus,
  <br>CSS makes it easy to change styles across several pages at once.
